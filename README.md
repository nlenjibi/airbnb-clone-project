AirBnB Clone — Backend Blueprint

This repository contains the blueprint and project documentation for the AirBnB Clone backend. The goal is to design and implement a robust, scalable backend to manage users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews using Django and related technologies.

## 🚀 Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support the core features of a short-term rental marketplace and is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- User Management: secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: allow hosts to create and manage property listings.
- Booking System: enable guests to search, book, and manage reservations.
- Payment Processing: integrate secure payment handling for bookings.
- Review System: support reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: use indexing and caching for efficient data access.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The project will use the following core technologies:

- Django: a high-level Python web framework for building the RESTful API and core business logic.
- Django REST Framework (DRF): tools for building RESTful endpoints, serializers, pagination, and authentication.
- PostgreSQL: the primary relational database for storing users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.
- GraphQL (optional): a flexible query layer (e.g., Graphene-Django) to support complex client queries.
- Celery: background task processing for asynchronous jobs (email notifications, payment processing, data sync).
- Redis: used as a message broker and cache (session store, caching frequent queries).
- Docker: containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- GitHub Actions (or equivalent): CI/CD pipelines for running tests, linting, and deployments.

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI / Swagger: REST API documented using OpenAPI for clarity and client generation.
- GraphQL Playground: (optional) interactive GraphQL interface when GraphQL is enabled.

## 📌 Endpoints Overview

The REST API will include the following endpoints (CRUD):

Users

- GET /users/ - List users
- POST /users/ - Create a new user
- GET /users/{user_id}/ - Retrieve a user
- PUT /users/{user_id}/ - Update a user
- DELETE /users/{user_id}/ - Delete a user

Properties

- GET /properties/ - List properties
- POST /properties/ - Create a property
- GET /properties/{property_id}/ - Retrieve a property
- PUT /properties/{property_id}/ - Update a property
- DELETE /properties/{property_id}/ - Delete a property

Bookings

- GET /bookings/ - List bookings
- POST /bookings/ - Create a booking
- GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Retrieve a booking
- PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Update a booking
- DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Delete a booking

Payments

- POST /payments/ - Process a payment

Reviews

- GET /reviews/ - List reviews
- POST /reviews/ - Create a review
- GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve a review
- PUT /reviews/{review_id}/ - Update a review
- DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/ - Delete a review

## Team Roles

Describe the responsibilities for each role involved in the project:

- Backend Developer: designs and implements API endpoints, models, serializers, and business logic. Ensures unit/integration tests and API documentation are up to date.
- Database Administrator (DBA): designs database schema, manages migrations, defines indexes and performance tuning strategies, and oversees backups/restore procedures.
- DevOps Engineer: configures containerization, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and deployment environments. Ensures scalable infrastructure and security in deployment.
- QA Engineer: writes manual and automated tests, performs test plans, verifies API behavior and regression testing, and reports bugs.
- Frontend Developer (optional): integrates with the backend APIs, builds UI components, and ensures correct consumption of GraphQL/REST endpoints.

## Database Design

Key entities and fields (suggested):

- Users

  - id (UUID)
  - email (unique)
  - full_name
  - hashed_password
  - is_host (boolean)
  - created_at, updated_at

- Properties

  - id (UUID)
  - host (FK -> Users)
  - title
  - description
  - address (street, city, state, country, lat/lng)
  - price_per_night (decimal)
  - capacity (integer)
  - created_at, updated_at

- Bookings

  - id (UUID)
  - property (FK -> Properties)
  - guest (FK -> Users)
  - check_in (date)
  - check_out (date)
  - total_price (decimal)
  - status (enum: pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed)
  - created_at, updated_at

- Payments

  - id (UUID)
  - booking (FK -> Bookings)
  - amount (decimal)
  - currency (string)
  - payment_provider (stripe/paypal/etc)
  - status (enum)
  - transaction_id (string)
  - created_at, updated_at

- Reviews
  - id (UUID)
  - property (FK -> Properties)
  - author (FK -> Users)
  - rating (integer)
  - comment (text)
  - created_at, updated_at

Relationships

- A User can be a host and can own multiple Properties.
- A Property has many Bookings.
- A Booking belongs to one Property and one User (guest).
- A Payment belongs to a Booking.
- Reviews belong to Properties and are authored by Users.

Indexing and Caching

- Add indexes on frequently queried fields: Users.email, Properties.host_id, Bookings.property_id, Bookings.guest_id, Bookings.check_in/check_out.
- Cache commonly-read endpoints (property listings, property details) using Redis and set sensible TTLs.

## Feature Breakdown

- User Management

  - Register, login, profile management, password reset. Ensures secure authentication using JWT or session-based auth.

- Property Management

  - Hosts create/update listings with photos, amenities, and pricing. Search and filtering by location, price, and availability.

- Booking System

  - Guests can create bookings with date validation and availability checks. Hosts can confirm or cancel bookings.

- Payment Processing

  - Integrate with payment providers (Stripe/PayPal) for secure payment handling. Capture payment status and reconcile with bookings.

- Review System

  - Guests can leave ratings and reviews after a completed stay. Aggregate ratings shown on property pages.

- Data Optimization
  - Pagination, selective fields, DB indexes, caching, and background tasks for expensive operations.

## API Security

Key security measures to implement:

- Authentication: Use secure authentication (JWT with refresh tokens or session cookies with CSRF protection). Store passwords hashed (bcrypt/Argon2).
- Authorization: Enforce role-based permissions (hosts vs guests) and object-level permissions (only hosts can edit their properties).
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Validate all incoming data and guard against injection attacks.
- Rate Limiting: Protect public endpoints from abuse using throttling (DRF throttling or API gateway).
- HTTPS Everywhere: Require TLS for all production traffic.
- Audit Logging & Monitoring: Log important events (logins, payments, booking changes) and monitor for suspicious activity.

Rationale: Security is critical to protect user data, financial transactions, and the platform's integrity. Implementing these measures reduces risk and helps maintain user trust.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Overview

- Use GitHub Actions (or similar) to run automated tests, linting, type checks, and build container images on every push or pull request.
- Steps typically include: install dependencies, run linters (flake8/isort/black), run tests (pytest), build Docker image, and deploy to staging.

Suggested pipeline stages

1. PR Validation: Run linting, unit tests, and security scans.
2. Build: Build and tag Docker images.
3. Integration Tests: Run lightweight integration tests against a test database (Postgres via Docker Compose).
4. Deploy: Deploy to staging/production via Kubernetes or cloud services.

Tools

- GitHub Actions: CI orchestration
- Docker: Packaging
- pytest + pytest-django: Testing
- Sentry/Prometheus: Monitoring and error reporting

## Manual Review

When the implementation is complete, request a manual QA review. Include the following checklist in the submission:

- Project is completed by the deadline.
- Repository is public and named `airbnb-clone-project`.
- README contains project overview, team roles, tech stack, database design, feature breakdown, API security, CI/CD plan, and manual review instructions.
- All required endpoints and models are implemented (if code is included).
- Provide a link to a live demo or deployment (if available).

When you're ready for manual QA, add a note in the repository and request the reviewers.
